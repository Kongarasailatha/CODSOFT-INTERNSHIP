The project's main goal is to provide a straightforward and efficient way for users to organize their tasks and improve productivity.

### Features:
This project helps you explore GUI development in Python and understand the basics of task management.

Add Tasks: Users can add tasks to their to-do list by entering task descriptions through the command-line interface. Each task will be recorded with a timestamp, indicating when it was added.

Remove Tasks: If a task is completed or no longer relevant, users can remove it from the to-do list using the command-line interface. The application will handle the task's deletion and provide appropriate feedback to the user

Delete ALL Tasks: If a task is added into To-do List then we want change it or delete all enter another To-do lists so,user can delete all.
Exit: This helpful to close or exit from To-do list

##### Technical Details:

The project will be implemented in Python, leveraging its simplicity and ease of use for a command-line application.
The main data structure for the to-do list will be a Python list, allowing for easy addition and removal of tasks.
File handling will be employed to read and write the to-do list to a local file, ensuring task persistence.
The project will be modular, with separate classes or functions for adding, removing, and displaying tasks, as well as for user input handling.
The command-line interface will be designed to display a menu of options and receive user input accordingly.
#### User Interaction:
Upon running the application, users will be presented with a simple command-line menu, where they can select from the following options:

Add Task: Allows users to input a new task description to be added to the to-do list.
Remove Task: Asks the user to input the task they want to remove and confirms the deletion.
Exit: Exits the application and saves the to-do list to a file for future use.
#### Conclusion: 
The "Simple To-Do List Manager" is an efficient and user-friendly Python application that allows users to maintain and organize their to-do lists effortlessly. 
By providing a straightforward command-line interface, the project enables users to focus on their tasks and stay on top of their daily responsibilities. 
With potential enhancements, the application can be expanded to cater to more complex task management needs and contribute to improved productivity and time management for users.
## Task-2 : Basic GUI Calculator:
### Description:
The "Basic GUI Calculator" is a Python-based application that provides a user-friendly graphical interface to perform basic arithmetic calculations. 
The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, making it suitable for everyday mathematical operations. 
The project's primary objective is to offer a simple and intuitive calculator interface that users can easily interact with to perform calculations.
### Features:

Graphical User Interface: The application utilizes the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface, providing buttons for numbers, arithmetic operators, and a display field to show the input and result of calculations.

Basic Arithmetic Operations: The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can input numerical values using the provided buttons and perform calculations by clicking on the corresponding operator buttons.

Real-Time Calculation: As users click on the number and operator buttons, the input will be displayed in real-time on the calculator's display field. This allows users to see the current expression they are entering.

Error Handling: The calculator implements error handling to prevent invalid calculations and display meaningful error messages when the user enters an incorrect expression.
### Technical Details:

The project is developed in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface.
The calculator's display field is implemented using a Tkinter Entry widget to show the user's input and the result of calculations.
The number and operator buttons are created using Tkinter Button widgets, and their corresponding functions are bound to the buttons to handle user interactions.
#### User Interaction: 
Upon launching the application, users will be presented with a simple GUI calculator. They can interact with the calculator using the following features:

-> Click on number buttons (0-9) to input numerical values.
-> Click on the operator buttons (+, -, *, /) to specify the desired arithmetic operation.
-> The input and result will be displayed in the calculator's display field.
-> Click on the "=" button to perform the calculation and display the result.
-> Click on the "C" button to clear the input field and start a new calculation.
-> Potential Enhancements: To enhance the project further, additional features could be implemented, such as:

Support for more advanced arithmetic operations (e.g., exponentiation, square root).
Implementation of keyboard input for numerical values and operators.
Incorporation of memory functionality to store and recall previous calculations.
Integration of a theme switcher to provide different visual styles for the calculator.
#### Conclusion: 
The "Basic GUI Calculator" is a straightforward and user-friendly Python application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic calculations through an intuiti intuitive graphical interface. By providing real-time input display and result updates, the calculator facilitates smooth interactions and helps users carry out mathematical operations efficiently.
With potential enhancements, the application can be expanded to accommodate more advanced calculations and personalized customization options, catering to a wider range of user preferences and mathematical needs.

## Task-3 : Generate Password
### Description:
The Random Password Generator project empowers users to create secure passwords with specified length and quantity. This project introduces concepts like randomization and user input handling in Python.
The project provides a command-line interface, allowing users to customize the password length and include various character types in the generated passwords.
### Features:
1.Random Password Generation: The application uses Python's random module to generate random characters for the password, ensuring that each generated password is unique and unpredictable.

2.Customizable Password Length: Users can specify the desired length of the password, allowing them to generate passwords of varying lengths to suit the security requirements of different platforms and accounts.

3.Character Types Inclusion: Users can choose to include different types of characters in the generated password, such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special symbols. This flexibility ensures that the generated passwords meet specific complexity criteria.

-> Set password length to meet security requirements.
->Generate a specified number of random passwords.
->Create strong and unique passwords for various purposes.
#### Technical Details:

The project is developed in Python, leveraging its random module to generate random characters for the password.
The application will utilize Python's string module to store character sets for different types of characters (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special symbols).

#### Conclusion:
The Password will be generate random by given length.
